# Sentence Case: Simplifying Text Formatting for Better Readability

When writing, it's important to format your content in a way that's easy for your audience to read. One common format is **sentence case**, where only the first letter of the first word in a sentence is capitalized, and the rest of the words are in lowercase. This formatting style enhances readability and is commonly used in both professional and casual writing.
